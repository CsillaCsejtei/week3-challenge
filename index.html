        Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a
        team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who primarily
        use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a
        pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the
        opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a
        rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally,
        the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match
        time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over
        200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.
